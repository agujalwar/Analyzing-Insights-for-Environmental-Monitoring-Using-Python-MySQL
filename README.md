# Analyzing-Insights-for-Environmental-Monitoring-Using-Python-MySQL
This project analyzes a real-world database for Environmental monitoring data (such as timestamp,carbon_monoxide, humidity, light,liquefied_petroleum_gas, motion, smoke, and temperature) for corresponding devices. 
In this project, I have implemented my Data analysis skills to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance, and to use a structured query language MySQL to retrieve useful information from the database.
# Module 1: Data preprocessing
# Module 2: Data Analysis using MySQL
